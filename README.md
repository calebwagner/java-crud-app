# CRUD Application

This is a simple CRUD application built with Spring Boot. It demonstrates basic CRUD operations on a `Course` entity using Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, and an H2 in-memory database.

## Technologies Used

1. **Spring Boot**:
    - Simplifies the configuration and setup of the Spring application.
    - Provides built-in functionalities for web servers, data access, and security.

2. **Spring Data JPA**:
    - Simplifies the implementation of JPA-based repositories.
    - Integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot.

3. **Hibernate**:
    - Provides object-relational mapping (ORM) for interacting with the database.
    - Used as the JPA implementation.

4. **H2 Database**:
    - In-memory database for development and testing.
    - Lightweight and fast database solution.

5. **Maven**:
    - Build automation tool for managing project dependencies, building the project, and running tests.

6. **Jakarta Persistence API (JPA)**:
    - Specification for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects and a relational database.
    - Provides the API for Hibernate and other ORM tools.
